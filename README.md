# 📞 Digital Arrest Detector

An AI-powered tool to **detect digital fraud, scams, and deepfakes** across multiple channels including **Text, Audio, and Video**.  
Built for real-time prevention, alerts, and awareness against modern cyber scams.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Scam Detection**
  - NLP-based classification (legit vs scam)
  - Keyword spotting for risky terms
  - Sentiment analysis for urgency/fear/threat

- **Audio Scam Detection**
  - Speech-to-text transcription (supports `en-in`, `hi`, `gu`)
  - ML-based scam probability scoring
  - Placeholder for deepfake/voice spoofing detection

- **Video Deepfake Detection**
  - Keras-based deepfake detection model (`Deepfakes_detection_model.keras`)
  - Classifies uploaded videos as **Likely Real / Deepfake**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Streamlit)
- **ML/NLP**: Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Keras
- **Audio Processing**: Vosk, SoundFile, Wave
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deployment Ready**: Streamlit (demo) / React or Vue (future)
